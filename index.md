I am a final year Electrical & Biomedical Engineering student at University of Queensland. I have keen interest in organoid intelligence and regenerative medicine. Currently, my thesis project is about "Detecting and Classifying Neurofibromas using Deep Learning", supervised by Professor Brian Lovell. I am also a certified erhu (二胡) street artist. Feel free to spot me at CBD, West End Market or Riverside Sunday Market! ♪

Your support to [my work](https://space.bilibili.com/670033492?spm_id_from=333.1296.0.0) is always my best motivation.

Fun fact: my favourite K-pop idol is Jennie ♡
