# About Me

I am a final year Electrical & Biomedical Engineering student at The University of Queensland. I have keen interest in organoid intelligence and regenerative medicine. Currently, my thesis project is about "Detecting and Classifying Neurofibromas using Deep Learning", supervised by Professor Brian Lovell. 

Apart from academics, I am a great music enthusiast, currently mastering the art of erhu (二胡) performance under the guidance of Ms Yangzi Liang. I have extensive experience in stage performances and solo competitions. Currently, I am also a certified erhu street artist. Feel free to spot me at CBD, West End Market or Riverside Sunday Market! ♪

Your support to [my work](https://space.bilibili.com/670033492?spm_id_from=333.1296.0.0) is always my best motivation.
