# Some Notes on t-SNE

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing and exploring high-dimensional data. It aims to represent complex patterns and relationships in the data by mapping it to a lower-dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D.

## History
t-SNE is based on Stochastic Neighbor Embedding developed by Sam Roweis and Geoffrey Hinton. The t-distrubuted variant is proposed by Laurens van der Maaten.

## Algorithm
The algorithm works by creating a probability distribution that describes the similarities between data points in the original high-dimensional space. It constructs a similar probability distribution in the lower-dimensional space, where points that are similar in the high-dimensional space have a higher probability of being neighbors. 
During the optimization process, t-SNE adjusts the positions of the points in the lower-dimensional space to minimize the difference between the two probability distributions, aligning similar points and spreading out dissimilar points. This process balances both local and global structures, preserving nearby relationships as well as capturing broader patterns.

## Comparison with Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA)

| Feature | t-SNE | PCA |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Dimensionality Reduction | Linear | Nonlinear |
| Visualization | Better for complex patterns and clusters | Limited ability for complex patterns and clusters |
| Preserves Global Structure | Yes | Yes |
| Preserves Local Structure | Yes | Less efficient |
| Computational Complexity | Higher complexity | Lower complexity |
